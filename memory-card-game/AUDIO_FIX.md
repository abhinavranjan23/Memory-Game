# Audio Cache Issue Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing `net::ERR_CACHE_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED` errors when trying to load audio notification files. This error typically occurs when the browser attempts to perform caching operations on resources that are not properly served or when there are issues with how audio files are being loaded.

## Root Cause

The audio files were being imported as static assets in the React components, which can cause caching issues in certain browser environments, especially during development.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved Audio Files to Public Directory

- Moved all audio files from `client/notifications/` to `client/public/audio/`
- This ensures they are served directly by the development server without going through the build process

### 2. Created Custom Audio Hook

- Created `useAudio.js` hook in `client/src/hooks/`
- Provides centralized audio management with better error handling
- Includes retry logic for failed audio playback
- Proper cleanup and initialization

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration

- Added `assetsInclude` for audio file types
- Added cache control headers to prevent caching issues
- Configured proper asset file naming for production builds

### 4. Refactored Game Component

- Removed direct audio imports from `Game.jsx`
- Replaced with the new `useAudio` hook
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Fixed unread message count logic to only count messages from other users
- Added message preview popup with user avatar, message content, and timestamp

### 5. Fixed Database Storage

- Updated game engine to properly maintain `flippedCards` and `matchedPairs` arrays
- Added proper array management when cards are flipped, matched, and flipped back
- Added database verification logging to ensure proper storage
- Fixed issue where card states weren't being persisted to database

### 6. Fixed Player Leave Event Bug

- **Bug**: In 3-4 player games, when a player left, other players were not receiving the "player-left" event
- **Root Cause**: Event emission was happening AFTER player removal from database, causing timing issues
- **Fix**:
  - Emit player-left event BEFORE removing player from database
  - Added fallback mechanism to emit to individual players as backup
  - Added comprehensive debugging to track event flow
  - Fixed race condition in event emission timing

## Files Modified

- `client/vite.config.js` - Added audio asset handling and cache headers
- `client/src/hooks/useAudio.js` - New custom hook for audio management with message notification
- `client/src/pages/Game.jsx` - Updated to use the new audio hook and added message notification sound
- `client/public/audio/` - New directory with audio files
- `server/src/socket/gameEngine.js` - Fixed database storage of flipped and matched cards
- `server/src/socket/index.js` - Fixed player leave event bug with timing and fallback mechanism

## Benefits

- Resolves cache operation errors
- Better error handling and retry logic
- Improved audio loading performance
- Cleaner code organization
- Better browser compatibility
- Added message notification sound for new chat messages
- Fixed unread message count to only include messages from other users
- Added message preview feature (Messenger-style) for quick message viewing
- Fixed database storage of flipped and matched cards
- Fixed player leave event bug ensuring all players are notified when someone leaves

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the game in a browser
3. Trigger audio events (card flips, matches, etc.)
4. Check browser console for any remaining audio errors

The audio files should now load without cache operation errors and play reliably across different browsers and environments.
